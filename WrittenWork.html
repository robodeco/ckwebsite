                        <em>Chop.</em>

                    <p>
                        The wood splits evenly, and to my satisfaction. Each swing results in a log fit for a king’s hearth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Chop.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which is a silly thought. It isn’t like a king cares about what logs go into his fireplace, only that it burns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Chop.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if he did, he’d be pretty damned pleased with my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Chop.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if he isn’t then I have a whole forest to get more from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Chop.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Screw that king, anyway,” I mutter. “Who says my wood isn’t good enough? Has he ever chopped wood, anyway? What does he know?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Chop.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s enough.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I set the axe down and gather up the freshly cut wood into neat piles, placing some underneath a tarp for storage and taking the others with me. My wood might be good enough for a king, but my house sure isn’t. I like it though. Its cozy. Its quiet. Its lonely.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        God. It’s so lonely.
                     </p>   
                    <p>
                        “Honey, I’m home,” I call as I step inside. My Doberman, Lady, trots to greet me with a dopey smile on her face and tail wagging, showing off how safe she’s kept the place in my brief absence. I smile down at her and nudge her out of my path to the stove. Its brand new, and the pride of my home (but I’d never tell Lady that.) No gas, no needless connection to a phone app, just a simple woodburning stove for one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aaaaand its missing its chicken,” I say aloud, casting a withering look at Lady. She cocks her head to the side, confused. “Don’t give me that. I thought a Lady would have better manners.” She licks her chops, adding insult to injury. As much as I’d like to be, I can’t be too mad. I was an idiot for forgetting that I was out of wood, and even more of an idiot for leaving my chicken on the pan where Lady could get to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I sigh, set the wood down, and walk to the fridge. It’s the only electric thing in the house besides my work computer and phone, and just like both I realize that it’s been greatly depleted when I open it. Which means that I must either kill another one of my chickens, dig into my stockpile, or go into town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A long, frustrated groan escapes me. Sensing my displeasure, Lady approaches from behind and nudges me with her head. “Get off,” I grumble, unable to help myself. The stockpile was for the winter and emergencies, and I’ve already killed too many chickens. That left town.
                    </p>
                    <p>I hate going into town.</p>

                    <p>
                        Upon a moonlit road we tread,
                        <br>
                        the shadows deep and grim.
                        <br>
                        Within their pools of dour dread,
                        <br>
                        an end as soft as riverbed,
                        <br>
                        awaits the traveler misled,
                        <br>
                        if they know not how to swim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you walk your weary way,
                        <br>
                        keep your candle close and bright.
                        <br>
                        Though thin the wick, though fragile flame,
                        <br>
                        though long the nightly peril's stay,
                        <br>
                        a single spark is all it takes,
                        <br>
                        and darkness turns to light.

                    <p>
                        I’ve never understood this living,
                        <br>
                        though find to live better than not.
                        <br>
                        Through times of pain and memory fraught,
                        <br>
                        because I feel, I am forgiving.
                        <br>
                        How curious, my paradox.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet through my fear I sought escape,
                        <br>
                        a place more mystic than my own.
                        <br>
                        Lightning in jars and talking stones
                        <br>
                        became so stodgy as I aged;
                        <br>
                        a greater land I longed to know. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A place of shadows in the night,
                        <br>
                        conjurers, covert cabals.
                        <br>
                        Where wonder kept me in its thrall!
                        <br>
                        Where faerie gave my body flight!
                        <br>
                        Icarus, blind to any fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No greater trap than in my head;
                        <br>
                        these fantasies upon the page.
                        <br>
                        Rather than escape this maze,
                        <br>
                        I took my spool of golden thread
                        <br> 
                        and with it wove a gilded cage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though now I seek to end this dream,
                        <br>
                        for as I live and breathe, I feel.
                        <br>
                        I’ll cut a door, my snare unsealed,
                        <br>
                        traverse old glades and mountain streams,
                        <br>
                        for magic always has been real.

                    <p>
                        I’ve breathed in deep the somber glow of slivered, setting sun,
                        <br>
                        I’ve frozen through the morning hues of day that’s just begun.
                        <br>
                        I’ve wandered under golden crowns that autumn lulled to sleep,
                        <br>
                        I’ve flown to mountain tall to leave my heart atop its peak.

                    <p>
                        Though joyous are your undertones, sorrow you instill.
                        <br>
                        Of what, I ask, the reason then, behind this airy thrill?
                        <br>
                        Your aura sparks a war in me which fights for my control.
                        <br>
                        What stirrings you instill becomes the aether of my soul.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are hello. You are goodbye. The journey in-between.
                        <br>
                        You are the fire in the dark where moonlight fails to gleam.
                        <br>
                        The warmth of family, Halloween, cinnamon-apple tea,
                        <br>
                        You are what was and what may come, and all my memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In you resides a promised land where feet may never travel,
                        <br>
                        the whispers of a parting love as life and mind unravels.
                        <br>
                        In this farewell, a smile soft that cuts me to my core,
                        <br>
                        but as each day must yield to night, the sun must rise once more.

                        <p>
                            Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl who lived within the walls of a castle high atop a mountain. Every day was spent in hiding, for they knew if the castle's Fae occupants ever found them, they would be killed.

                            Inspired by the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttoH475qTVA" target="_blank">Serity</a>  by Vallis Alps, my award-winning novel took me roughly five years to complete. It is self-published, edited by award-winning and bestselling author <a href="https://reedsy.com/Claire-Ashgrove" target="_blank">Claire Ashgrove</a>, and has a cover made by oil-painter <a href="https://www.joncpool.com/" target="_blank">JC Pouzols</a> with typography by <a href="https://reedsy.com/lena-yang" target="_blank">Lena Yang</a>. Find out more on its dedicated website!
